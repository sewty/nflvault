## Overall
- Probably average, but can hit the ceiling this year. They have the pieces for it.
- OLine, QB the difference makers here
	- if they don't work, everything falls apart
## 2023-2024
- 10-7 overall
	- 5-4 home
	- 5-3 away
	- 3-2 last 5
	- 3rd in div
- 22.6 QBS (25/32)
- Power Score 16.2 (14/32)
	- RushO 12/32
	- PassO 32/32
	- RushD 11/32
	- PassD 8/32
	- Points For 28/32
	- Points Allowed 6/32
	- Points Diff 21/32
- Largest positive differential between QBS Ranking and Power Score. Won 10 games with the worst passing offense and 5th worst points scored. Actually a miracle.
## OC?
- Matt Canada (23-24)
	- Nightmare of an offense
	- Run/Pass calls too predictable
	- Couldn't work the middle of the field. Didn't challenge down the field
	- Pickett didn't perform at all
- Arthur Smith (24-25)
	- ATL LMAO
	- Good OC at TEN
	- Expect lot of outside zone, switches to duo (running offense)
	- Works the middle as well as down the field more, which is a positive
		- however, didn't throw much in ATL (could be QB issue)
	- Didn't get playmakers the ball. BUT overall offensive philosophy was alright, given good QB play. 
	- Could work in PIT, buuuut QB??? Russ isn't known for dominating the middle of the field. Russ/Arthur seems like an odd match.
	- Wilson/Pickens combo could work well. Standout CBs could be troublesome for this team.
## Defense
- "Steelers Defense"
	- Rush 4, have the guys to do it, they do it well
	- Downs 1 and 2 -> Cover 3
		- We're stopping the run (at all costs), getting TFLs, get you to 3rd down
	- Down 3
		- If short, Cover 1 (man), trust the execution, needs good corners (JPJ)
		- If long, Cover 2
	- Simple defense that works when you have the pieces, which they mostly do
- Assuming they stay healthy, they'll be a top 10 defense

## Personnel
- GM Omar Kahn
- HC Mike Tomlin
- OC Arthur Smith (without the stache)
- DC Teryl Austin
- STC Danny Smith
## Fantasy

## Notable Roster Changes
### Losses

### FAs/Resigns
- IDL Montravius Adams
- WR *Cordarrelle Patterson*
- LB *Patrick Queen*
- QB Russell Wilson
- QB Justin Fields
- S Deshon Elliot
- WR Van Jefferson
### Rookies

- LB Payton Wilson

## Summary
- This team improved, but they overperformed (at least on record) last year, so it might not look like it
	- Probably a wildcard team. Competitive, but not with the top flight of the AFC
- 10/11-win ceiling
- 9-win floor *Tomlin never goes negative LMAO*
