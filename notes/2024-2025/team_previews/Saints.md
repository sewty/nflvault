## OVR

- Fantasy
	- Chris Olave (WR12)
	- Rashid Shaheed (WR55)
	- Kendre Miller (RB44)
	- *Will Lutz*
	- Avoid Kamara
- Lack of consistency
- QB Play sus. In reality, Derek Carr is getting asked to do a lot for a very static offense
- Hard team to predict
- Last Year -> 9-8 OVR
	- Something off
	- SOS < .450 -> weak, numbers inflation?
	- 2nd in div
	- 5-3 home
	- 4-5 away
	- 4-1 last 5
- Power Score says how well a team did, QBS suggests how well they should've done
	- 64.5 QBS (12/32)
	- Power Score = 10.5 (6/32)
		- Rushing 19/32
		- Passing 15/32
		- Rush D (3/32)
		- Pass D (9/32)
		- Points Scored (9/32) -> deceiving (middle of league until Week 17 vs Falcons, where they dropped 48)
		- Points allowed (8/32)
		- Points Diff (7/32)
	- The interesting thing here is that the Saints, on paper, overperformed. But nobody would've called this team the 6th best last year...
- What caused the problems?
	- (8/32) on redzone trips (3.5), but only scored TD on 53% (well below avg) -> good at getting there, bad at finishing
		- Grab *Will Lutz* if he still kicking?
	- ~12th in most passing/receiving stats -> horribly YAC tho
- Personnel (2024)
	- Mickey Loomis (GM), Dennis Allen (HC), Klint Kubiak (OC), Joe Woods (DC), Darren Rizzi (STC)
### Changes
- Offensive staff was completely reworked
	- Klint Kubiak (OC) and Benton (OLine) -> Shanahan style offense
		- Wide zone, play action, deep crosses
- Didn't spend much in FA -> Chase Young biggest addition 
- Rookies -> Taliese Fuaga (LT), KoolAid (CB), Rattler (QB)
- Expect stronger OLine
### Summary / Prediction
- Did this team get better?
	- Debatable - tough to say because the numbers look so good. If they did get better, are they actually going to reach their potential?
	- Roster is about even (only really 2-4 new starters)
- Ceiling: 10 wins
- Floor: 7 wins
